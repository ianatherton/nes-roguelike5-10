# Arkista's Ring Asset Extraction Guide

This guide outlines the process for legally extracting assets from your copy of Arkista's Ring for use in the Craven Caverns project.

## Legal Considerations

- You must own a legal copy of Arkista's Ring
- The extracted assets should only be used for personal, non-commercial projects
- The final game should be substantially different from the original
- Consider this a fan project or demake with educational purposes

## Required Tools

- **FCEUX** - NES emulator with debugging capabilities
- **Tile Layer Pro** or **YY-CHR** - For graphics viewing/extraction
- **FamiTracker** - For music analysis and recreation
- **HxD** or another hex editor - For examining ROM data

## Asset Types to Extract

### Graphics
- Character sprites (player, enemies)
- Background tiles
- UI elements
- Item sprites

### Audio
- Music patterns and instruments
- Sound effects

### Game Data
- Enemy behavior patterns
- Level layouts (for inspiration)

## Extraction Process

### Graphics Extraction

1. **Using FCEUX's PPU Viewer**:
   - Load your Arkista's Ring ROM in FCEUX
   - Open Debug > PPU Viewer
   - Identify sprite patterns (CHR data)
   - Export sprite sheets as PNG

2. **Using YY-CHR**:
   - Open your ROM file
   - Navigate through the CHR banks
   - Export tiles and sprites as images

### Audio Extraction

1. **Using NSFRip**:
   - Extract the NSF music data from the ROM
   - This contains the music data in a format usable by FamiTracker

2. **Using FamiTracker**:
   - Analyze the musical patterns
   - Note instruments and sound settings
   - Recreate similar themes with modifications

### Level and Game Data

1. **Using FCEUX's Hex Editor and Debugger**:
   - Analyze memory during gameplay
   - Identify level data structures
   - Document enemy behavior patterns

## Organizing Extracted Assets

Place extracted assets in the following project folders:
- `/assets/sprites/` - Character and object sprites
- `/assets/backgrounds/` - Background tiles and patterns
- `/assets/music/` - Music files and patterns
- `/assets/sfx/` - Sound effects

## Adapting Assets for Our Game

- Modify sprites to fit our roguelike theme
- Reorganize tile patterns for procedural generation
- Create new sprite sheets combining elements from different sources
- Adapt music to fit different dungeon themes

## Tools To Build

We'll need to develop some custom tools to help with asset processing:
- Tile map converter for NES format
- Sprite sheet optimizer
- Audio converter for NES sound format

These will be developed as part of the project and placed in the `/tools/` directory.
