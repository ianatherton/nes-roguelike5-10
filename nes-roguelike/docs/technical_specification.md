# Craven Caverns: Technical Specification

## NES Hardware Specifications

### CPU
- Ricoh 2A03/2A07 (based on MOS 6502)
- Clock speed: 1.79 MHz (NTSC), 1.66 MHz (PAL)
- 8-bit processor

### Memory
- 2KB of RAM
- Up to 32KB PRG ROM per bank (game code)
- Up to 8KB CHR ROM per bank (graphics data)
- Memory mapping through cartridge hardware (mappers)

### Graphics
- Resolution: 256×240 pixels (commonly cropped to 256×224)
- Color palette: 52 colors (plus transparency)
- 64 sprites maximum, 8 per scanline limit
- Sprite size: 8×8 or 8×16 pixels
- Background: 32×30 tiles (8×8 pixels each)

### Sound
- 5 channels:
  - 2 pulse wave channels
  - 1 triangle wave channel
  - 1 noise channel
  - 1 PCM/DPCM channel

### Mapper Target
- We'll use MMC3 (Mapper 4), similar to Castlevania III
- Allows for bank switching and expanded capabilities
- Provides 512KB PRG ROM and 256KB CHR ROM potential

## Technical Implementation

### Development Environment
- CC65 compiler suite (C language for 6502)
- NESASM assembler (for assembly language portions)
- ca65 (alternative assembler)
- Mesen or FCEUX for testing and debugging
- Asset extraction and conversion tools

### Game Engine Components

#### Memory Management
- Bank switching for larger game content
- RAM usage optimization
- Save state handling (if implemented)

#### Rendering System
- Sprite and background management
- Animation systems
- Screen scrolling
- UI rendering

#### Procedural Generation
- Dungeon layout algorithm (limited by memory constraints)
- Room templates with variation
- Deterministic random number generation (seed-based)

#### Gameplay Systems
- Turn-based logic
- Collision detection
- Combat calculations
- Item and inventory management
- Enemy AI state machines

#### Audio Engine
- Music playback system
- Sound effect triggering
- Priority handling for audio channels

### Asset Management
- Tile compression
- Sprite design constraints
- Background layout optimization
- Music and SFX storage

### Performance Considerations
- Limiting entities per screen
- Optimizing rendering routines
- Managing NMI and frame timing
- Reducing CPU intensive calculations

## Development Tools

### Asset Extraction
- Custom tools for extracting sprites, tiles, and audio from Arkista's Ring ROM
- Conversion utilities for adapting assets to our format

### Level Design
- Custom level editor or tile arrangement tools
- Validation tools for level data

### Testing Framework
- Automated testing for game logic where possible
- Visual verification through emulation

## Build Process
1. Compile C/Assembly code
2. Assemble graphics and audio assets
3. Link components together
4. Generate iNES format ROM file
5. Test in emulator
6. Verify on hardware (optional)
